# Lingoda Teacher Rating

This project provides a platform for personalized teacher reviews, addressing the lack of such functionality in Lingoda's official offering.

**This is an open source projectâ€”enthusiasts interested in contributing are welcome to open a pull request!**

## Features

- **Personalized Teacher Reviews:** Users can rate and review teachers after classes.
- **React + TypeScript + Vite:** Modern frontend stack for fast development and HMR.
- **Persistent Storage:** User ratings and reviews are managed and persisted in the browser using [nanostores](https://github.com/nanostores), ensuring data is retained across sessions.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

2. **Run the development server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Motivation

Lingoda currently lacks a way for students to leave personalized feedback for teachers. This project fills that gap, empowering students to share their experiences and help others make informed choices.
